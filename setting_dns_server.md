1. Check your DNS settings:
   ```
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   This should show your current DNS servers. If it's empty or incorrect, that's likely the cause of the problem.

2. Set DNS servers manually:
   ```
   echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
   echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" >> /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   This will add Google's DNS (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1) to your resolv.conf file.

3. Restart the DNS resolver:
   ```
   /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
   ```

4. If you're using DHCP, you might want to check your DHCP settings to ensure it's providing correct DNS information:
   ```
   uci show dhcp
   ```

5. If you're still having issues, try updating your package lists and upgrading:
   ```
   opkg update
   opkg upgrade
   ```

6. After making these changes, try pinging github.com again:
   ```
   ping github.com
   ```

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, there might be a more complex networking problem at play. In that case, you might need to check your network configuration, firewall rules, or consult the OpenWrt documentation for more advanced troubleshooting steps.

Remember to save your configuration changes if you want them to persist across reboots:

```
uci commit
```
