To find the error in the `make_logs.md` file, you can use the `grep` command to search for error messages. Here are a few commands you can try:

1. Search for "Error" messages:

```bash
grep -n "Error" ~/openwrt/make_logs.md
```

2. Search for "failed" messages:

```bash
grep -n "failed" ~/openwrt/make_logs.md
```

3. Search for both "Error" and "failed" messages:

```bash
grep -n -E "Error|failed" ~/openwrt/make_logs.md
```

4. To see more context around the errors, you can use the `-C` option with grep. For example, to see 5 lines before and after each match:

```bash
grep -n -E "Error|failed" -C 5 ~/openwrt/make_logs.md
```

5. If you want to focus on errors related to gltollgate specifically:

```bash
grep -n -E "Error|failed" -C 5 ~/openwrt/make_logs.md | grep -i gltollgate
```

6. To see the last 100 lines of the log file, which often contain the most recent errors:

```bash
tail -n 100 ~/openwrt/make_logs.md | grep -n -E "Error|failed"
```

These commands will help you identify error messages in the log file. The `-n` option with `grep` will show line numbers, which can be helpful for locating the errors in the file.
